# Artificial-Intelligence-Course-Algorithms-nQueen-Problem-Genetic-Algorithm-Map-Coloring-CSP-
This contains some of the Artificial courses Algorithms. All the codes are done in python. - nQueen Problem ( There is one to calculate the and show the attacks and fitness of a board another to make a non-attacked board ), Genetic Algorithm ( Used in 8 Queen Problem. User will say the number of the boards and generations and the program will take random board and calculate fitness for each generation and then apply genetic algorithm on them. ), CSP Map Coloring Problem ( One is done only using a simple heuristic and another one uses both heuristic and mrv to solve the problem and also shows simulation ).
